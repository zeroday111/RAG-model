# RAG-model


Explanation of the QA Application Components
Overview
The QA application leverages advanced language processing techniques to provide answers to user queries by retrieving relevant information from a document database. The key components of this application are the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) model and the embedding techniques used to process and retrieve documents.

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) Model
The RAG model is a powerful approach that combines retrieval-based and generation-based methods for question answering:

Retrieval-Based Approach:

Document Retrieval: When a query is submitted, the system first retrieves relevant documents from a pre-processed and indexed database. This ensures that the answer generation process has access to the most pertinent information.
Chroma Vector Store: The application uses Chroma, a vector store that efficiently indexes and retrieves documents based on their embeddings. This allows for quick and accurate retrieval of relevant document chunks.
Generation-Based Approach:

Language Model (Ollama): After retrieving the relevant documents, the system uses a language model to generate a coherent and contextually appropriate answer. In this application, the Ollama model is used for this purpose. It synthesizes information from the retrieved documents to generate a concise answer.
Embeddings
Embeddings are a crucial part of how the application processes and understands both the query and the documents:

HuggingFace Embeddings:

Model: The application uses embeddings from the HuggingFace library, specifically the model "all-MiniLM-L6-v2". This model converts text into high-dimensional vectors that capture the semantic meaning of the text.
Usage: These embeddings are used to represent both the query and the documents in a way that makes it easy to compare and find similarities. When a query is submitted, it is converted into an embedding, which is then compared against the embeddings of document chunks stored in the Chroma vector store.
Document Processing and Storage:

Ingestion Script: The script ingest_documents.py is responsible for processing documents. It loads documents from a specified directory, splits them into manageable chunks, and converts these chunks into embeddings.
Text Splitter: To ensure that the documents are in the right format for processing, the text is split into chunks using the RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter. This helps manage long documents by breaking them down into smaller, semantically meaningful pieces.
Storage: These chunks and their corresponding embeddings are stored in the Chroma vector store, which allows for efficient retrieval during the query process.
Process Flow
Initialization:

The application initializes the embeddings and loads the pre-processed document embeddings into the Chroma vector store.
It sets up the Tkinter-based GUI for user interaction.
Query Submission:

Users enter their query into the GUI and submit it.
The query is converted into an embedding.
Document Retrieval:

The query embedding is used to search the Chroma vector store for the most relevant document chunks.
The retrieved document chunks are passed to the language model.
Answer Generation:

The language model (Ollama) uses the context provided by the retrieved document chunks to generate a coherent answer.
The answer is displayed in the GUI along with the relevant sources, if not hidden by the user.
